**Research Abstract**: This study explores how organizational design and agents' roles affect the ability to generate predictive knowledge necessary for achieving strategic goals in dynamic organizational environments. Through an analysis of 20 cases in the IP value chain of large organizations, we discovered that decision-makers can effectively use a combination of hierarchical and horizontal coordination mechanisms. Additionally, we identified four distinct roles played by agents in shaping predictive knowledge. This study presents a new framework that emphasizes the interplay between organizational design and agent contributions, advancing our understanding of predictive knowledge generation in complex settings. Our findings provide valuable insights for optimizing the strategic design of critical organizational functions, such as the IP value chain, which can impact innovation and competitiveness.
